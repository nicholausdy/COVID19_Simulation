# COVID-HACKATON 2020
## SARS-COV-2 Simulation of Indonesia
### Overview
A system is developed to predict the on-going pandemic that is currently experienced by the world.
The system is based on using historical data of the pandemic in Japan using a Monte-Carlo mathematical model, in order to reduce 
data overfit, the obtained data is then applied to RNN data learning. 
This will lead to more accurate system to predict Indonesia's current projectory of casualties to help local authorities to prepare measurement that would prevent the spreading of the pandemic.
<br>This system is created in event of COVID-HACKATON 2020 dating 27 March to 29 March.
